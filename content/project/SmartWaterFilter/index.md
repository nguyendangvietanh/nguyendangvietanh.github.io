LAVI is a start-up company operating in the field of accessories for Motorhomes. In collaboration with SOPLAIR company, LAVI seeks to develop a range of intelligent products to improve the comfort of the motorhome: the EZA range.

The mission of EZA Water is to draw used water to be reprocessed. The primary objective of this innovation is to improve the comfort and autonomy of motorhome owners. The mission entrusted is to design an intelligent and low-consumption electronic system to check the correct operation of the hydraulic system using sensors (detecting the clogging and leaking problems). This system can communicate with the user via a touch screen and a beep sound.

The maintenance software makes it possible to modify the parameters of the system and to recover recorded data files on the the micro SD card. Thus, the company has a simple and effective tool to analyze the causes of malfunction and ensure product traceability.

Mr. Nguyen and his team (as 4 future engineers of Grenoble INP-ESISAR) researched and developed this product of LAVI company during six months (Jan-Jul, 2017). The tasks of Mr. Nguyen focus on the design of a Printed Circuit Boards (PCB), Human Machine Interface (HMI) development, and sensors/signal processing.
