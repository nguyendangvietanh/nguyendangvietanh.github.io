abstract: Cholesteatoma is an accumulation of exfoliated keratin from squamous epithelium that invades the middle ear, erodes the bony structures, and causes hearing loss as well as other serious complications. The only treatment of this disease is surgical intervention. As the middle ear cavity is small and contains hidden recesses, the complete removal of the disease is still challenging and the recurrence rate can reach 25% for conventional methods. An advanced treatment for this disease is laser surgery that has been proven to remove efciently the residual cholesteatoma, thus reducing the recurrence rate [1]. In the ÂµRoCS project, we aims to propose a dexterous continuum robot with embedded laser instrument for exhaustive cholesteatoma removal. As part of this project, this study focuses on measuring the vaporized volume of cholesteatoma during the laser ablation process depending on the laser parameters. This volume will be obtained using OCT scanning and the proposed image processing. The result has an important role to vaporize the right amount of cholesteatoma tissue as insufcient removal would result in cholesteatoma recurrence and excessive removal would damage the healthy structures nearby.
