Jérôme Szewczyk received a MS degree (1994)
in mechanical engineering from University of
Compiegne, FR and a PhD degree (1998) in robotics at University of Paris VI. 
He was assistant professor from 2000 to 2010 at University of Versailles and
is now full professor at Sorbonne University at the
Institut des Systemes Intelligents et de Robotique. 
He is the author of over 100 technical publications. 

His research activities concern the design of
sensors and actuators for meso-robotics based on
smart materials and the optimal design of robotic
structures for surgical applications. In particular, he is interested in the
development and optimization of robotic surgical instruments and active
flexible catheters for minimally invasive interventions.
