Laurent Lefèvre got his BSc from the Ecole Polytechnique de Bruxelles (1991) and his MSc in applied mathematics from Ecole Polytechnique de Louvain (1994), both in Belgium. 
Then he moved to France and got his PhD in control from Ecole Centrale de Lille (Cristal lab, 1999). 
In 2000, he obtained an associated professor position in the Grenoble control lab (Gipsa lab) and from 2005 in the Lyon lab for process and control (LAGEP). 
Since 2011 he is full professor with the Laboratoire de Conception et d’Intégration des Systèmes (LCIS) and Grenoble Institute of Technology (Grenoble INP) in the fields of applied mathematics and control. 

His current domains of interest are numerical methods for control, structured modelling for complex systems and nonlinear control. Laurent Lefèvre was involved in various collaborative research projects related to complex water systems, complex thermodynamics systems, smart DC microgrids and plasma physics.
