The only treatment of this disease is surgical intervention. As the middle ear cavity is small and contains hidden recesses, the complete removal of the disease is still challenging and the recurrence rate can reach 25% for conventional methods. An advanced treatment for this disease is laser surgery that has been proven to remove efciently the residual cholesteatoma, thus reducing the recurrence rate [1]. In the ¬µRoCS project, we aims to propose a dexterous continuum robot with embedded laser instrument for exhaustive cholesteatoma removal. As part of this project, this study focuses on measuring the vaporized volume of cholesteatoma during the laser ablation process depending on the laser parameters. This volume will be obtained using OCT scanning and the proposed image processing. The result has an important role to vaporize the right amount of cholesteatoma tissue as insufcient removal would result in cholesteatoma recurrence and excessive removal would damage the healthy structures nearby.","tags":[],"title":"OCT as tool for laser ablation monitoring applied to cholesteatoma","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dang-Viet-Anh Nguyen","J√©r√¥me Szewczyk","Kanty Rabenorosoa"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

It is a serious form of chronic otitis presented as an abnormal proliferation of epidermal tissue, with desquamation and destruction of surrounding bones. As a consequence, complications can be dizziness, meningitis (or other brain infections), facial palsy or total and irreversible deafnes. The only current treatment is to remove the infected tissues through a surgical operation. However, the associated risk of recurrences due to residual cholesteatoma can reach 23-25% of cases depending on the country and age group. Follow-up strategy is systematically applied and induces a painful second examination of the patient, along with additional costs. The complete removal of cholesteatoma is thus a considerable limitation of current practices due to the limited dexterity of the surgical tools working in the tiny and confined space of the middle ear cavity.\nTherefore, the ¬µRoCS project proposed a surgical robotic system including flexible microrobots which enable contact with hard-to-reach anatomical targets inside the middle ear and perform the cholesteatoma removal by laser. The aim of this project is to reduce the cholesteatoma recurrence by removing efficiently all infected cells from the first operation with a minimally invasive surgery. This microrobotic system will improve the accuracy and repeatability of the surgeon‚Äôs gestures. The accurate detection of cholesteatoma cells is supported by using optical biopsies. Thanks to a millimeter size and a high bending curvature of its distal end, the flexible surgical tool would improve the accessibility and minimize the need for large incisions.\nThis project is funded by ANR (Agence Nationale de la Recherche) with the partners including CHRUB (Centre Hospitalier R√©gional Universitaire de Besan√ßon), INSERM (Institut National de la Sant√© et de la Recherche M√©dicale), FEMTO-ST (Franche-Comt√© √âlectronique M√©canique Thermique et Optique - Sciences et Technologies), and ISIR (Institut des Syst√®mes Intelligents et de Robotique).

These problems lead us to find other energy sources as well as a better solution in power distribution in order to reduce the power losses. This project considered the DC part of a hybrid AC/DC microgrid with a meshed topology. It addressed the cost minimization, the battery scheduling and the power loss minimization within the power distribution network through constrained optimization. The novelty came from applying differential flatness properties to the microgrid components and formulating the cost and constraints in terms of the associated B-splines parametrization of the flat outputs (the voltages and currents of the system). This allowed obtaining optimal power profiles to minimize the power dissipation and the cost of the electricity purchase from the external grid. Based on the weather forecast and the historical power consumption data, these profiles were tracked using a model predictive control at the higher level, while the lower level deals with the operation of the switches within the DC/DC converters. Extensive simulations under nominal and fault-affected scenarios using realistic data validate the proposed approach.\nThis project, in the collaboration between LCIS (in Valence) and Ampere labs (in Lyon), is funded by ANR (Agence Nationale de la Recherche) within the framework of the project ANR-15-CE05-0004 C3Œº (Components, Control and Communication for DC microgrid).\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f7e5e35aed56620a69494c73034f5a8d","permalink":"https://example.com/project/powertransimissionnet/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/powertransimissionnet/","section":"project","summary":"ANR - LCIS (2018)","tags":["Power Distribution Network"],"title":"Power Balancing in a DC-meshed Microgrid Through Constrained Optimization (C3Œº project)","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The project focused on modeling and closed-loop controls (PID, LQR, MPC) of a laboratory helicopter using conventional control methods. The system consisted of a body, carrying two propellers driven by DC motors, and a massive support. The body had two degrees of freedom. Both body position angles (elevation and azimuth) were influenced by rotation of propellers. Center of gravity was changed by moving small weight along the main horizontal axis of helicopter by a servomotor. The mathematical model of the helicopter system was a typical MIMO 2x2 system with significant cross-couplings. The electromechanical system can be linearized to a linear sixth-order model when operating near the steady state. A multifunctional card MF624 was used as interface module between PC based controller and helicopter system. It was designed for data acquisition and transmission. The card can be optimized for use with MATLAB/Simulink Real Time Toolbox. It also provided implementation of the control algorithms from the PC to the helicopter system. The user communicates with the system via Real Time Toolbox interface, all input/output signals were dimensionless and scaled into the MU (Machine Unit). The MATLAB/Simulink xPC Target Toolbox can be used to perform the experiments in real time applications.\nThis project is funded by Grenoble INP-UGA at the Esynov platform under the supervision of Professor (Associate) Ionela Prodan.\nAs member of the innovation project, Mr. Nguyen started his work as a research intern in the summer of 2017, then became the team leader of this project (Sep - Dec, 2017).\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"7dc74768e53c5c7e01a075ec0af196aa","permalink":"https://example.com/project/helicoptersystem/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/helicoptersystem/","section":"project","summary":"Esynov (2017)","tags":["Helicopter System"],"title":"Simulation, control \u0026 experimental testing on a helicopter system (CE150)","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Yann Nguyen is an ENT professor at the Otolaryngology Department, in Hospital Piti√© Salp√™tri√®re (Sorbonne University, AP-HP), in Paris, France.
